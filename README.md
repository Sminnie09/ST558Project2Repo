Project Objective: The goal is to create models for predicting the
`shares` variable from the dataset. You will create two models: a linear
regression model and a non-linear model (each of your choice). You will
use the parameter functionality of markdown to automatically generate an
analysis report for each `weekday_is_*` variable (so youâ€™ll end up with
seven total outputted documents).
